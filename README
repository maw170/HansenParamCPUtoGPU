This directory containes pre and post processing code from SURF 2014

Code that is designed to run for the CPU (aka code that was written during the summer of 2014) will be stored in the directory CPU.  This code is located under ./examples/CPU.
Code that is deisnged to run for the GPU (aka code that was written during the first few weeks of SURF 2015) will be stored in the directory src.  It should be noted that 
code in this directory will be directly based on the cpu code.  The majority of the changes will involve converting iterating loops to GPU kernels

Initial content:
	examples/CPU:
		datagen-2.f90 (will likely not be converted)----------------------------------Preprocessing code used to correctly assign forcefields
		CAL.ctrl----------------------------------------------------------------------Postprocessing code used to control variables of code below
		Density-unidat.cpp (will likely not be converted)-----------------------------Postprocessing code used to compute the density of the sample
		hansencompute-unidat.cpp------------------------------------------------------Postprocessing code used to calculate the hansen solubility parameters after molecular data had been collected by postproc-unidat.f90
		postproc-unidat.f90 (may rewrite in cpp for convenience)----------------------Postprocessing code used to calculate energies of individual molecules
	GPU:
		HansenComputeGPU.cpp----------------------------------------------------------Initial component of project; GPU version of hansencompute-unidat.cpp
